            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS His Majestie hath been informed that in former times the Beere Brewed, and sold in the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> by the common Brewers, was usually of three sorts, the lowest at foure shillings foure pence the Barrell, the second at seven shillings the Barrell, and the highest at ten shillings the Barrell, and sometimes at greater rates, and so after those propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for greater or lesser quantity; and Ale at rates altogether uncertain. Forasmuch as it is more agreeable with the season of the yeare, aswell as the present state of the times, that strong Beere and Ale be forborne, for the saving of unnecessary expences, and for the health of those who shall spend the same: His Majestie doth therefore charge and command all Beere-Brewers, and Ale-Brewers, and all others who brew either Beere or Ale to sell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to brew no Beere or Ale above the rate of seven shillings the Barrell, and so after that rate for a greater, or lesser quantity; and the smaller Beere or Ale at foure shillings foure-pence the Barrell, and so after the same rate for a greater or lesser quantity. And that there may be no want of Beere or Ale for the use of those who live within the Quarters of the said Army, or resort thither, His Majestie doth further give leave to all Persons, who will, to brew and sell Beere or Ale when, and as often as they will without restraint, they making their Beere, and Ale good and wholesome, and selling the same at the rates, and for the prices aforesaid. And this His Majestie commandeth to be duely observed at the perill of those who shall presume to offend herein. And whereas some complaint hath been, that the common Streames in and about this City, wherewith the Brewers are served with Water, are much more annoyed of late then formerly by the casting of DÅ«ng, and other filth thereinto, to the endangering the health of this City, His Majesty doth strictly charge, and Command, that all such abuses either wilfully or negligently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, be from henceforth forborne. And that they may not escape unpunished, His Majesty doth require, and command <hi>George Thorp</hi> the Water-Bayliffe of the River, and <hi>Iohn Taylor,</hi> joyntly, and severally, to take speciall care for the giving of true Information to His Majesties Commissioners appoynted for the care of his Army, and of this City, of all abuses tending to the annoyance of the River or Water in or about this City, and by whom they are committed, or by whose default, that due punishment may be inflicted upon all such offenders. And His Majesty doth hereby further straitly charge and command all those that doe, and shall sell Ale or Beere, within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Quarters of His Majesties Army that they, and every of them, sell a full Ale quart of Beer or Ale of the strong sort thereof unto every Souldier in His Majesties Army for a peny, and not above that rate, and of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler sort of Beere and Ale, a Pottle for a peny. And the offenders herein must take knowledge, that they shall receive such punishment, as shall be fit to be laid upon such offences, as would be the causes of so great hurt, and disorder in the Army. And His Majesty doth hereby require, and command all Commanders, and Officers in His Army that they, and every of them, imploy their best indeavours, that His Majesties pleasure herein before signified, for so much as concerns His Souldiers, be duly executed, and observed. <hi>Given at His Maiesties Court at</hi> Oxford <hi>the</hi> Twelfth <hi>day of</hi> June, <hi>in the Nineteenth yeare of His Majesties Raigne.</hi>
